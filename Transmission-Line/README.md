This matlab code gets the required input from the user to calculate the efficiency and voltage regultion of the transmission line.

The first section gets all the parameters required for the calculation and asks the user to specify the method in which the user wants to proceed in solving the problem.

Input parameters: 
Rated Power,
Power Factor,
Frequency,
Receiving end Voltage,
Resistance per Km,
Transmission line length,
Conductor diameter,
Spacing between Conductor,

Models available: 
Nominal T,
Nominal Pi,
Short Transmission line,
Long Transmission line.

Based on the inputs given by the user and the matlab code proceeds to calculate and returns the voltage requlation and efficiency in the specified method.
